title: vLLM Model Deployment
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
The vLLM Model Deployment App is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

The vLLM Model Deployment application enables users to quickly deploy LLMs as networking services over a secure 
endpoint. This application supports various model configurations and customizations to optimize performance and resource 
usage. The vLLM Model Deployment application serves your model(s) on a machine of your choice. Once an app instance is running, 
it serves your model through a secure, publicly accessible network endpoint. 

The app supports multi-model hosting and Universal Memory technology, enabling inactive models to be offloaded to other memory options to free GPU resources:
* CPU RAM – via `Automatic CPU Offloading`, `CPU Offload GiB`, and configurable `Max CUDA Memory` limits.
* Disk storage – via `Swap Space` and `Disk Swapping` (when `Automatic CPU Offloading` is disabled).

The app monitors endpoint activity and shuts down if the model remains inactive over a specified maximum idle time.

:::info AI Application Gateway
The vLLM Model Deployment app makes use of the App Gateway Router which implements a secure, authenticated 
network endpoint for the model.

If the ClearML AI Application Gateway is not available, the model endpoint might not be accessible.
For more information, see [AI Application Gateway](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/appgw.md).
:::

Once you start a vLLM Model Deployment instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:

:::tip EMBEDDING CLEARML VISUALIZATION
You can embed plots from the app instance dashboard into [ClearML Reports](../webapp_reports.md). These visualizations 
are updated live as the app instance(s) updates. The Enterprise Plan supports embedding resources in 
external tools (e.g. Notion). Hover over the plot and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-plotly-embed-code.svg" alt="Embed code" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to copy the embed code, and navigate to a report to paste the embed code.

## vLLM Model Deployment Instance Configuration

When configuring a new vLLM Model Deployment instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the 
configuration of a previously launched instance. 

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled configuration form can be edited before launching the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's configuration form.

### Configuration Options
* **Import Configuration**: Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Instance name**: Name for the vLLM Model Deployment instance. This will appear in the instance list
* **Service Project (Access Control)**: The ClearML project where the app instance is created. Access is determined by 
  project-level permissions (i.e. users with read access can use the app).
* **Queue**: The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which the vLLM Model Deployment app 
instance task will be enqueued (make sure an agent is assigned to that queue)
* **AI Gateway Route**: Select an available, admin-preconfigured route to use as the service endpoint. If none is selected, an ephemeral endpoint will be created.
* **Model Configuration**: Configure the behavior and performance of the model engine.
  * Trust Remote Code: Select to set Hugging Face [`trust_remote_code`](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/main/en/reference/launcher#trustremotecode) 
  to `true`.
  * CLI: vLLM CLI arguments. If set, these arguments will be passed to vLLM and all following entries will be ignored, 
  except for the `Model` field.
  * Enforce Eager: Forces PyTorch [eager mode](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/concepts.html#eager-mode) for execution.
  If not selected, a hybrid of eager mode and CUDA graph will be used for maximal performance and flexibility.
  * Enable Automatic Prefix Caching: Caches key-value pairs for shared prefixes across requests. This reduces 
  computational overhead and memory usage by reusing cached KV pairs for subsequent requests with the same prefix. For 
  more information, see [Automatic Prefix Caching](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.9.2/features/automatic_prefix_caching.html).
  * Disable Sliding Window: Prevents the model from using a sliding window for input processing. Instead, it caps the 
  input length to the sliding window size and processes the entire sequence as a whole.
  * Enable Reasoning: Enables model to generate [reasoning content](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/reasoning_outputs.html).
  * Enable Auto Tool Choice: When set, vLLM will automatically choose between supported tool-call parsers. Requires to select parser backend in `Tool Call Parser`
  * Model: A ClearML Model ID or a HuggingFace model name (e.g. `openai-community/gpt2`)
  * Model Endpoint Name: The name to be used for API access.  
  * Multimedia Limit per Prompt: Set limits on the number of multi-modal inputs allowed for each prompt. Input a comma-separated 
  list of items, e.g., `image=16,video=2` allows a maximum of 16 images and 2 videos per prompt. Defaults to 1 for each modality  
  * Max Context Length: Maximum model context length. If unspecified, it will be derived from the model config.  
  * Max Number of Sequences per iteration: Maximum number of sequences that can be processed together in a single iteration  
  * Speculative Draft Tensor Parallel Size: Maximum sequence length covered by CUDA graphs. Longer sequences fall back to eager mode.  
  * Tool Call Parser: Select which tool-call parser to use when `Enable Auto Tool Choice` is enabled. These parsers 
  convert model output into OpenAI API–compatible tool calls. For more information about the parsers, see [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/tool_calling.html).   
  * Tool Parser plugin: Name of a registered parser plugin for custom tool-call parsing. If set, this plugin can be 
  referenced by the parser selected in the `Tool Call Parser` field.  
  * Max Num Batched Tokens: Maximum number of batched tokens per iteration  
  * Reasoning Parser: Select the reasoning parser depending on the model that you're using. This is used to parse the 
  reasoning content into OpenAI API format. Required if `Reasoning` is enabled. For more information about reasoning parser, 
  see [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.9.1/features/reasoning_outputs.html).  
  * Model Implementation: Which implementation of the model to use:   
    * No selection (default): Use the vLLM implementation if it exists and fall back to the Transformers implementation 
    if no vLLM implementation is available.   
    * `vllm`: Use the vLLM model implementation.  
    * `transformers`: Use the Transformers model implementation  
  * GPU Memory Utilization: The fraction of GPU memory to be used for the model executor, which can range from 0 to 1. 
  Default: 0.9.
  * GPUs (Tensor Parallel Size): Number of GPUs used to load the model. Defaults to the number of GPUs detected on the machine  
  * Swap Space: CPU swap space size (GiB) per GPU  
  * CPU Offload GiB: Space in GiB to offload to CPU per GPU. Default 0, which means no offloading. This allows for a 
  virtual increase in GPU memory size (e.g., for a 24 GB GPU with 10 GiB set, it appears as 34 GB). Requires fast 
  CPU-GPU interconnect during model operations.  
  * Quantization: Method used to quantize the weights. If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in 
  the model config file. If that is `None`, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine 
  the data type of the weights.   
  * Dtype: Data type for model weights and activations. Select one of the following:  
    * `auto`: If selected, will use base model data type.  
    * `float16`  
    * `bfloat16`  
    * `float32`  
  * KV Cache Dtype: Data type for KV cache storage. Select one of the following:   
    * `auto`: If selected, will use the model data type.   
    * `fp8`  
    * `ffp8_e5m2`

  * Random Seed   
  * Max Logprobs: Max number of log probabilities to return if requested.  
  * Max Concurrent Requests: The maximum number of concurrent requests for this particular deployment. Having a low 
  limit will deny client requests instead of having them wait for too long  
  * RoPE Theta: Use with `RoPE Scaling`. In some cases, changing the theta improves the performance of the scaled model.  
  * RoPE Scaling: RoPE scaling configuration in JSON. For example, `{"rope_type":"dynamic","factor":2.0}`.  
  * Revision: The specific Hugging Face version of the model (i.e. weights) you want to use. You can use a specific commit 
  ID or a branch like `refs/pr/2`.  
  * Code Revision: The specific revision to use for the model code on HuggingFace Hub. It can be a branch name, a tag 
  name, or a commit ID. If unspecified, will use the default version.  
  * Tokenizer: A ClearML Model ID or a Hugging Face tokenizer  
  * Tokenizer Revision: The specific tokenizer Hugging Face version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a 
  commit ID. If unspecified, will use the default version.  
  * Tokenizer Mode: Select the tokenizer mode:  
    * `auto`: Uses the fast tokenizer if available  
    * `slow`: Uses the slow tokenizer.  
  * Speculative decoding: The speculative decoding technique improves inter-token latency in memory-bound LLM inference.

    * Speculative Decoding Acceptance Method: Select the acceptance method to use during draft token verification:   
      * `RejectionSampler`: Does not allow changing the acceptance rate of draft tokens  
      * `TypicalAcceptanceSampler`: Allows for a higher acceptance rate at the cost of lower quality, and vice versa.  
    * Num Speculative Tokens: Number of speculative tokens to sample.  
    * Speculative Disable By Batch Size: Disable speculative decoding for new incoming requests if the number of enqueue 
    requests exceeds this value.  
    * Speculative Draft Tensor Parallel Size: Tensor parallel replicas for the draft model.  
    * Speculative Max Model Len: Maximum sequence length for the draft model. Sequences over this length will skip 
    speculation.  
    * Speculative Model Quantization: Choose the quantization method for the speculative model. If set to `None`, the app 
    checks the `quantization_config` in the model's configuration file. If that is also `None`, the app assumes the model 
    weights are not quantized and uses the dtype to determine the data type.  
  * Num Lookahead Slots: Experimental scheduling config necessary for speculative decoding.  
  * Model Overrides: Add to or override this model's configuration. The model options have to correspond to 
  [vLLM options](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/engine_args/). For example, `pipeline_parallel_size` 
  corresponds to the `--pipeline-parallel-size` option in vLLM. To set a flag, pass `flag: true`, for example, `enforce_eager: true` 
  corresponds to the `--enforce-eager` flag
* **LoRA Configuration** 
  * Enable LoRA: If checked, enable handling of [LoRA adapters](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/training/lora#lora).
  * LoRA Modules: LoRA module configurations in the format `name=path`. Multiple modules can be specified.

  * LoRA Dtype: Select the data type for LoRA. Select one of the following:
    * `auto`: If selected, will default to base model data type.
    * `float16`
    * `bfloat16`
    * `float32`    
  * Max CPU LoRAs: Maximum number of LoRAs to store in CPU memory. Must be greater or equal to the 
  `Max Number of Sequences` field in the General section below. Defaults to `Max Number of Sequences`.
  * Enable LoRA Bias: Enable bias for LoRA adapters
  * Fully Sharded LoRAs: Use fully-sharded LoRA layers. By default, half of the LoRA computation is sharded with tensor 
  parallelism. Fully-sharded LoRAs uses tensor parallelism to shard the entire LoRA computation.

  * Scheduling Policy: Select one of the following:  
    * `fcfs`: Requests are handled first come, first served (in order of arrival)  
    * `priority`:  Requests are handled based on given priority (lower value means earlier handling) and time of arrival 
    deciding any ties  
  * Task: Task to use the model for. Select one of the following:   
    * auto: When the model only supports one task, "auto" can be used to select it. Otherwise, you must specify
