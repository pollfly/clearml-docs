title: Virtual Machine Remote Desktop
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
The Virtual Machine Remote Desktop application  is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

The **Virtual Machine Remote Desktop** application allows you to launch a VM on a remote machine in your cluster complete 
with an active remote access session: Select either Remote Desktop or SSH access.

The app offers workspace management features, allowing you to store, sync, and restore interactive workspaces across sessions.
This ensures that all your work is preserved and can be easily accessed in future sessions.

The remote desktop session is set up using a [ClearML Agent](../../clearml_agent.md). When configuring an app instance, 
select a queue, and the agent servicing that queue will set up the remote environment. 

:::important AI Application Gateway
The Virtual Machine Remote Desktop relies on the ClearML App Gateway Router which implements user authentication and 
securely routes incoming requests to the remote desktop session. 

If the ClearML AI Application Gateway is not available, the remote desktop session might not be accessible.
For more information, see [AI Application Gateway](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/appgw.md).
:::

Once you have launched an app instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:

* App status indicator
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vmdesktop-active.svg" alt="Active server" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - Remote desktop session is setting up
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vmdesktop-loading.svg" alt="Loading server" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - Remote desktop session is active
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vmdesktop-idle.svg" alt="Idle server" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - Remote desktop session is idle
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vmdesktop-stopped.svg" alt="Stopped server" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - Remote desktop session is stopped
* Idle time
* Restored workspace - If a previous sessionâ€™s workspace was restored, this will display that session's ID
* Current session ID
* Shareable Browser Link - Opens the remote desktop session directly in your web browser. This link performs user 
  authentication automatically through the browser: it verifies your credentials, adds the necessary cookies, and then 
  redirects you to the active session. 
* Direct Link - A direct endpoint to the running session, intended for programmatic access (e.g. connecting from an external 
  application or script). This link does not include browser-based authentication, so you must manually provide an [Application Gateway](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/appgw.md) 
  access token when sending requests. You can generate a token in the ClearML Web UI under **Settings** > **Workspace** > **AI Application Gateway**. 
* Server's resources monitoring (CPU / GPU / vMem utilization)
* Console - The console log shows the instance's activity, including server setup progress, server status changes

## VM Remote Desktop Instance Configuration
When configuring a new Remote Desktop Session instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the configuration 
of a previously launched instance.

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:

* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's configuration 
prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled instance launch form can be edited before starting the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> to open the app's instance launch form.

### Configuration Options

* **Import Configuration**: Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
  values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Application Session Name**: Name for the application instance. This will appear in the instance list
* **Type** - Select how you want to connect:
  * `Remote Desktop` for web based remote desktop access, 
  * `SSH` for SSH access to the remote machine
* **Application instance project**: The ClearML project where the app instance is created. Access is determined by 
  project-level permissions (i.e. users with read access can use the app).
* **Queue** - The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which theVM Remote Desktop 
  app instance task will be enqueued. <br/><br/> 
  :::info Agent requirements
  Make sure the agent assigned to this queue runs in an environment with Sysbox installed
  :::
* **Idle Time Limit** (Hours): Maximum time of inactivity, after which the session will shut down. Configure idleness 
  definitions under Advanced Options.
* **Environment Variables**: Additional environment variable to set inside the container before launching the application
* **Advanced Options**
  * Application Session Tags: Comma separated list of tags to add to your remote session
  * Restore application state from a previous session ID: Select the ID of a previous application session to restore
  * Idle Network Threshold: Throughput under which the session will be considered idle
  * Idle CPU Threshold: CPU utilization under which the session will be considered idle
  * Idle GPU Threshold: GPU utilization under which the session will be considered idle
* **Export Configuration**: Export the app instance configuration as a JSON file, which you can later import to create 
  a new instance with the same configuration
