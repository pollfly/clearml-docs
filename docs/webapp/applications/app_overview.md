---

ClearML Applications are a new, experimental approach for extending ClearML functionality.

The applications are a collection of wizards that offer a variety of functionalities where users don't have to 
handle code.

The applications include:
* AWS auto-scaler - optimize AWS EC2 instance scaling according to the instance types and budget configured 
* Hyperparameter optimization - performing optimization with ability to specify an optimization strategy, targets, parameter values and ranges, and experiment and time limits
* Nvidia Clara - Create an instance of Clara, Nvidia's framework for healthcare and lifesciences developers
* Project Dashboard - Monitoring a project's progress, a metricâ€™s statistics, and GPU and worker usage. The app also supports Slack alerts for task failure.
