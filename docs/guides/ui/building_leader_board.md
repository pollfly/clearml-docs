title: Tracking Leaderboards
---

In this tutorial, you will set up a tracking leaderboard. A tracking leaderboard allows easy monitoring of tasks 
using a customized [task table](../../webapp/webapp_exp_table.md) with auto refresh for continual updates.

The tracking leaderboard can be customized to include columns with information about:
* Task status
* Elapsed time since the task started and last updated
* Most recent iteration
* Metrics
* Hyperparameters
* And more. 

Bookmark the leaderboard in the browser to reuse and share the leaderboard URL with other users.

For this tutorial, use one of the following as a project:

* Recommended: One of your projects with more than one task. 
* Clone the [clearml](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml) repository and execute some of the example scripts.

## Step 1: Select a Project

The leaderboard will track tasks in one or all projects. 

Begin by opening the [ClearML Web UI](../../webapp/webapp_overview.md) and selecting a project, by doing one of the following:
* On the Dashboard, click a project card or **VIEW ALL**.
* On the Projects page, click a project card or the **All projects** card.

## Step 2: Filter the Tasks

The task table allows filtering tasks by name, type, and status.

**Apply any combination of the following filters:**

* Name - Use the search bar to find tasks containing any search term.
* Type - Click the **TYPE** column's filter and then on the list select any of the following:
    * **Training**
    * **Testing**
    * **Controller**
    * **Data Processing**
    * And others, depending on the types of tasks in the project 
* Status - Click the **STATUS** column's filter and then on the list select any of the following:

    * **Draft** - The task is not running.
    * **Pending** - The task is in a queue waiting to be run by a worker.
    * **Running** - The task is currently running by a worker.
    * **Completed** - The task ran and terminated successfully.
    * **Failed** - The task ran and terminated with an error.
    * **Aborted** - The task ran and was manually or programmatically terminated.
    * **Published** - The task is not running, it is preserved as read-only.

## Step 3: Hide the Default Columns

Customize the columns on the tracking leaderboard by hiding any of the default columns shown below.

**To select the defaults, do the following:**

1. Click settings. 
1. Select / clear any combination of the default columns from the following:

    * **TYPE** - The type of task: training, testing, or other, depending on the types of tasks in the project.
    * **NAME** - The name of the task.
    * **STATUS** - The status of the task.
    * **PROJECT** - The project name.
    * **USER** - The user creating or running the task.
    * **STARTED** - The elapsed time since the task started running.
    * **UPDATED** - The elapsed time since the task update.
    * **ITERATION** - The last iteration of the task. For tasks with a status of `Running`, this is the most recent iteration. For `Completed`, `Aborted`, and `Failed` tasks, this is the final iteration.

## Step 4: Show Metrics or Hyperparameters

The leaderboard can contain any combination of metrics and hyperparameters. For each metric, choose whether to view the last (most 
recent), minimum, and/or maximum values.

**To select metrics or hyperparameters:**

1. Click settings. 
1. For metrics, click **+ METRIC**, expand a metric category, and then select the metric checkboxes of those to show in 
   the leaderboard, and select the metric values (min / max / last).
1. For hyperparameters, click **+ HYPERPARAMETERS**, and then select the hyperparameter checkboxes of those to show in the leaderboard.

## Step 5: Enable Auto Refresh

Auto refresh allows monitoring the progress of tasks in real time. It is enabled by default. 

**To enable / disable auto refresh:**

* Hover over refresh and then check / clear the **Auto Refresh** checkbox.

## Step 6: Save the Tracking Leaderboard

The URL for **ClearML Web UI** now contains parameters and values for the customized leaderboard. Bookmark it to be able 
to return to the leaderboard and monitor the tasks.
