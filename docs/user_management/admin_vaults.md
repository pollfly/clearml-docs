title: Administrator Vaults
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
Administrator Vaults are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

Administrators can set configuration for users, [service accounts](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users.md#service-accounts), 
and [user groups](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users.md#user-groups) within a ClearML workspace by using central configuration 
stores--or Administrator Vaults.

Administrators can define multiple [configuration vaults](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#configuration-vault) which will 
each be applied to their designated [user groups](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users.md#user-groups), allowing for custom settings to be centrally managed. 
Configuration vault values are applied to tasks run by members of the designated user groups. When applied, the configuration 
vaults extend and/or override entries in the local ClearML [configuration file](../configs/clearml_conf.md)
where a ClearML task is executed.

Administrator vaults can be managed using both the [UI](#managing-vaults-via-the-clearml-ui) and [REST API](#managing-vaults-via-the-rest-api).

## Managing Vaults via the ClearML UI

Manage administrator vaults in ClearML UI, under **SETTINGS \> Administrator Vaults**. Through this interface, administrators can:

* **View** and **enable/disable** vaults   
* **Create** vaults  
* **Edit** vault contents.

For more information see [Administrator Vaults](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_admin_vaults) settings page.

## Managing Vaults via the REST API

Administrator Vaults can be managed programmatically using the ClearML REST API. 

### ClearML Server

API calls should be made to the API Server component, which, by default, is available in port 8008 if using HTTP, under 
the subdomain `https://api.<clearml-server-domain>` or using the API path with the Web Server (e.g. `https://<clearml-server-domain>/api`).

From this point on, the server address will be referred to as `CLEARML_SERVER`.

### Authentication

To authenticate REST API calls, you need ClearML Server credentials. Specifically, to manage organization vaults, you must use Admin User credentials. In the example below, `CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY` and `CLEARML_SECRET_KEY` refer to ClearML Admin User credentials.

An API token is required for all API calls, and should be generated using the admin credentials.

#### Generating an API Token

To generate an API Token, use the following command:

```
export CLEARML_API_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY:$CLEARML_SECRET_KEY" $CLEARML_SERVER/auth.login | jq -r '.data.token')
```

All subsequent API calls can use this token by providing the authorization header with a bearer token:

```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLEARML_API_TOKEN}" <clearml-server>/...
```

### Administrator Vault API

#### List Existing Vaults

To list all existing vaults, use the following command:

```
curl -s $CLEARML_SERVER/users.get_vaults -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLEARML_API_TOKEN"
```

The command returns a list of vaults in JSON format, under the `data` fields. For example:

```
{
   "meta": {
       ...
   },
   "data": {
       "vaults": [
           {
               "data": "",
               "description": "",
               "enabled": true,
               "format": "hocon",
               "id": "<vault_ID>",
               "scope": "user",
               "type": "config"
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

This list also includes the admin user's personal vault defined using the ClearML UI interface in the **SETTINGS > Workspace**
section. This vault will appear as above, with the `user` value in the scope field. Administrator vaults use the ` group` scope.

#### Create a Vault

To create a new vault, use the following command:

```
curl -s -XPUT $CLEARML_SERVER/users.add_or_update_vault \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $CLEARML_API_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
   "group": "30795571-a470-4717-a80d-e8705fc776bf",
   "vault": {
       "scope": "group",
       "enabled": true,
       "data": "<vault configuration, same format as in clearml.conf>",
       "format": "hocon",
       "type": "config"
   }
}'
```

In the example above, the group ID `"30795571-a470-4717-a80d-e8705fc776bf"` refers to the Users group (to which all users 
belong). You can define other groups in the [Users & Groups](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users#user-groups) 
settings page and create vaults for these specific groups.

The command returns the ID of the newly created vault. For example:

```
{
   "meta": {
       ...
   },
   "data": {
       "vault": "ccc9bab1269542189ef088712436043f"
   }
}
```

#### Update a Vault

To update an existing vault, use the following command:

```
curl -s -XPUT $CLEARML_SERVER/users.add_or_update_vault \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $CLEARML_API_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
   "group": "30795571-a470-4717-a80d-e8705fc776bf",
   "vault": {
       "id": "<existing-vault-id>",
       "scope": "group",
       "enabled": true,
       "data": "<vault configuration, same format as in clearml.conf>",
       "format": "hocon",
       "type": "config"
   }
}'
```

Note that while this call is almost identical to the vault creation call, it includes a specific vault ID (`<existing-vault-id>`).

#### Delete a Vault

To delete an existing vault, use the following command:

```
curl -s -XPUT $CLEARML_SERVER/users.delete_vaults \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $CLEARML_API_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw '{
   "vaults": ["<vault-id>"]
}'
```

Where `<vault-id>` is the ID of the vault to delete. Multiple vaults can be deleted by providing a list of IDs, 
formatted as `"vaults": ["<vault-id-1>", "<vault-id-2>", ...]`.  

:::note
Do not delete the user scope vault as it is managed by the UI.
:::

The command returns output like this:

```
{
   "meta": {
       ...
   },
   "data": {
       "deleted": 1
   }
}
```
