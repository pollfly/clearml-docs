title: Manual Deployment with Command Line
---

This page explains how to install and deploy ClearML Agent on bare-metal servers and VMs.

## Installation


To install [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent.md), execute
```bash
pip install clearml-agent
```

:::info
Install ClearML Agent as a system Python package and not in a Python virtual environment.
An agent that runs in Virtual Environment Mode or Conda Environment Mode needs to create virtual environments, and
it can't do that when running from a virtual environment.
:::

## Configuration

:::note
If ClearML was previously configured, follow [this](#adding-clearml-agent-to-a-configuration-file) to add 
ClearML Agent specific configurations
:::

1. In a terminal session, execute
   ```bash
   clearml-agent init
   ```

    The setup wizard prompts for ClearML credentials (see [here](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#clearml-api-credentials) about obtaining credentials).
    ```
    Please create new clearml credentials through the settings page in your `clearml-server` web app, 
    or create a free account at https://app.clear.ml/settings/webapp-configuration
    
    In the settings > workspace page, press "Create new credentials", then press "Copy to clipboard".

    Paste copied configuration here:    
    ```
    
    If the setup wizard's response indicates that a configuration file already exists, follow the instructions [here](#adding-clearml-agent-to-a-configuration-file). 
   The wizard does not edit or overwrite existing configuration files.

1. At the command prompt `Paste copied configuration here:`, paste the ClearML credentials and press **Enter**. 
   The setup wizard confirms the credentials. 
        
   ```
   Detected credentials key="********************" secret="*******"
   ```
        
1. **Enter** to accept the default server URL, which is detected from the credentials or enter a ClearML web server URL.

   A secure protocol, https, must be used. **Do not use http.**
    
   ```
   WEB Host configured to: [https://app.clear.ml] 
   ```
        
   :::note
   If you are using a self-hosted ClearML Server, the default URL will use your domain.        
   :::
   
1. Do as above for API, URL, and file servers.

1. The wizard responds with your configuration:
   ```
   CLEARML Hosts configuration:
   Web App: https://app.clear.ml
   API: https://api.clear.ml
   File Store: https://files.clear.ml
        
   Verifying credentials ...
   Credentials verified!
   ```

1. Input the default output URI. Model checkpoints (snapshots) and task artifacts will be stored in this output location.

   ```
   Default Output URI (used to automatically store models and artifacts): (N)one/ClearML (S)erver/(C)ustom [None]
   ```

1. Enter your Git username and password. Leave blank for SSH key authentication or when only using public repositories.
   
   This is needed for cloning repositories by the agent.
   ```
   Enter git username for repository cloning (leave blank for SSH key authentication): []
   Enter password for user '<username>':
   ```     
   The setup wizard confirms your git credentials.
   ``` 
   Git repository cloning will be using user=<username> password=<password>        
   ```
1. Enter an additional artifact repository, or press **Enter** if not required.
   
   This is needed for installing Python packages not found in pypi. 

   ```
   Enter additional artifact repository (extra-index-url) to use when installing python packages (leave blank if not required):
   ```
    The setup wizard completes.
   
   ```
   New configuration stored in /home/<username>/clearml.conf
   CLEARML-AGENT setup completed successfully.
   ```
   
    The configuration file location depends upon the operating system:
            
    * Linux - `~/clearml.conf`
    * Mac - `$HOME/clearml.conf`
    * Windows - `\User\<username>\clearml.conf`

1. Optionally, configure ClearML options for **ClearML Agent** (default docker, package manager, etc.). See the [ClearML Configuration Reference](../configs/clearml_conf.md)
   and the [ClearML Agent Environment Variables reference](../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_env_var.md). 
   
:::note
The ClearML Enterprise server provides a [configuration vault](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#configuration-vault), the contents 
of which are categorically applied on top of the agent-local configuration
:::


### Adding ClearML Agent to a Configuration File

In case a `clearml.conf` file already exists, add a few ClearML Agent specific configurations to it.<br/>

**Adding ClearML Agent to a ClearML configuration file:**

1. Open the ClearML configuration file for editing. Depending upon the operating system, it is:
    * Linux - `~/clearml.conf`
    * Mac - `$HOME/clearml.conf`
    * Windows - `\User\<username>\clearml.conf`

1. After the `api` section, add your `agent` section. For example:
   ```
   agent {
       # Set GIT user/pass credentials (if user/pass are set, GIT protocol will be set to https)
       git_user=""
       git_pass=""
       # all other domains will use public access (no user/pass). Default: always send user/pass for any VCS domain
       git_host=""
   
       # Force GIT protocol to use SSH regardless of the git url (Assumes GIT user/pass are blank)
       force_git_ssh_protocol: false
   
       # unique name of this worker, if None, created based on hostname:process_id
       # Overridden with os environment: CLEARML_WORKER_NAME
       worker_id: ""
   }   
   ```
   View a complete ClearML Agent configuration file sample including an `agent` section [here](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent/blob/master/docs/clearml.conf).

1. Save the configuration.

### Dynamic Environment Variables
Dynamic ClearML Agent environment variables can be used to override any configuration setting that appears in the [`agent`](../configs/clearml_conf.md#agent-section) 
section of the `clearml.conf`.

The environment variable's name should be `CLEARML_AGENT__AGENT__<configuration-path>`, where `<configuration-path>` 
represents the full path to the configuration field being set. Elements of the configuration path should be separated by 
`__` (double underscore). For example, set the `CLEARML_AGENT__AGENT__DEFAULT_DOCKER__IMAGE` environment variable to 
deploy an agent with a different value to what is specified for `agent.default_docker.image` in the clearml.conf.

:::note NOTES
* Since configuration fields may contain JSON-parsable values, make sure to always quote strings (otherwise the agent 
might fail to parse them)
* To comply with environment variables standards, it is recommended to use only upper-case characters in 
environment variable keys. For this reason, ClearML Agent will always convert the configuration path specified in the 
dynamic environment variable's key to lower-case before overriding configuration values with the environment variable 
value.

## Spinning Up an Agent
You can spin up an agent on any machine: on-prem and/or cloud instance. When spinning up an agent, you assign it to 
service a queue(s). Utilize the machine by enqueuing tasks to the queue that the agent is servicing, and the agent will 
pull and execute the tasks. 

:::tip cross-platform execution
ClearML Agent is platform-agnostic. When using the ClearML Agent to execute tasks cross-platform, set platform 
specific environment variables before launching the agent.

For example, to run an agent on an ARM device, set the core type environment variable before spinning up the agent:

```bash
export OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=ARMV8
clearml-agent daemon --queue <queue_name>
```
:::

### Executing an Agent
To execute an agent, listening to a queue, run:

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue <queue_name>
```

### Executing in Background
To execute an agent in the background, run:
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue <execution_queue_to_pull_from> --detached
```
### Stopping Agents
To stop an agent running in the background, run:
```bash
clearml-agent daemon <arguments> --stop
```

### Allocating Resources
To specify GPUs associated with the agent, add the `--gpus` flag.

:::info Docker Mode
Make sure to include the `--docker` flag, as GPU management through the agent is only supported in [Docker Mode](clearml_agent_execution_env.md#docker-mode).
:::

To execute multiple agents on the same machine (usually assigning GPU for the different agents), run:
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --gpus 0 --queue default --docker
clearml-agent daemon --gpus 1 --queue default --docker
```
To allocate more than one GPU, provide a list of allocated GPUs
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --gpus 0,1 --queue dual_gpu --docker
```

### Queue Prioritization
A single agent can listen to multiple queues. The priority is set by their order.

```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue high_q low_q
```
This ensures the agent first tries to pull a Task from the `high_q` queue, and only if it is empty, the agent will try to pull 
from the `low_q` queue.

To make sure an agent pulls from all queues equally, add the `--order-fairness` flag.
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue group_a group_b --order-fairness
```
It will make sure the agent will pull from the `group_a` queue, then from `group_b`, then back to `group_a`, etc. This ensures 
that `group_a` or `group_b` will not be able to starve one another of resources.

### SSH Access
By default, ClearML Agent maps the host's `~/.ssh` into the container's `/root/.ssh` directory (configurable, 
see [clearml.conf](../configs/clearml_conf.md#docker_internal_mounts)).

If you want to use existing auth sockets with ssh-agent, you can verify your host ssh-agent is working correctly with:

```commandline
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

You should see a path to a temporary file, something like this:

```console
/tmp/ssh-<random>/agent.<random>
```

Then run your `clearml-agent` in Docker mode, which will automatically detect the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable, 
and mount the socket into any container it spins. 

You can also explicitly set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable when executing an agent. The command below will 
execute an agent in Docker mode and assign it to service a queue. The agent will have access to 
the SSH socket provided in the environment variable.

```
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=<file_socket> clearml-agent daemon --gpus <your config> --queue <your queue name>  --docker
```

## Google Colab

ClearML Agent can run on a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) instance. This helps users to leverage 
compute resources provided by Google Colab and send tasks for execution on it. 

Check out [this tutorial](../guides/ide/google_colab.md) on how to run a ClearML Agent on Google Colab!

## Explicit Task Execution

ClearML Agent can also execute specific tasks directly, without listening to a queue.

### Execute a Task without Queue

Execute a Task with a `clearml-agent` worker without a queue.
```bash
clearml-agent execute --id <task-id>
```
### Clone a Task and Execute the Cloned Task

Clone the specified Task and execute the cloned Task with a `clearml-agent` worker without a queue.
```bash
clearml-agent execute --id <task-id> --clone
```

### Execute Task inside a Docker

Execute a Task with a `clearml-agent` worker using a Docker container without a queue.
```bash
clearml-agent execute --id <task-id> --docker
```

## Debugging

Run a `clearml-agent` daemon in foreground mode, sending all output to the console.
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --queue default --foreground
```

## Services Mode

ClearML Agent supports a **Services Mode** where, as soon as a task is launched off of its queue, the agent moves on to the 
next task without waiting for the previous one to complete. This mode is intended for running resource-sparse tasks that 
are usually idling, such as periodic cleanup services or a [pipeline controller](../references/sdk/automation_controller_pipelinecontroller.md). 

To run a `clearml-agent` in services mode, run:
```bash
clearml-agent daemon --services-mode --queue services --create-queue --docker <docker_name> --cpu-only
```

To limit the number of simultaneous tasks run in services mode, pass the maximum number immediately after the 
`--services-mode` option (for example: `--services-mode 5`).

:::note Notes
* `services-mode` currently only supports Docker mode. Each service spins on its own Docker image.
* The default `clearml-server` configuration already runs a single `clearml-agent` in services mode that listens to the 
  `services` queue.
:::

Launch a service task like any other task, by enqueuing it to the appropriate queue.

:::warning
Do not enqueue training or inference tasks into the services queue. They will put an unnecessary load on the server.
:::

### Setting Server Credentials

Self-hosted [ClearML Server](../deploying_clearml/clearml_server.md) comes by default with a services queue.
By default, the server is open and does not require username and password, but it can be [password-protected](../deploying_clearml/clearml_server_security.md#user-access-security).
In case it is password-protected, the services agent will need to be configured with server credentials (associated with a user).

To do that, set these environment variables on the ClearML Server machine with the appropriate credentials:
```
CLEARML_API_ACCESS_KEY
CLEARML_API_SECRET_KEY
```
