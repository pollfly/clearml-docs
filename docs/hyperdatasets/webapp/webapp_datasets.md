:::important ENTERPRISE FEATURE
Hyper-Datasets are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

Use the Hyper-Datasets Page to navigate between and manage hyper-datasets. 

You can view the Hyper-Datasets page in Project view <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-project-view.svg" alt="Project view" className="icon size-md" /> 
or in List view <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-flat-view.svg" alt="List view" className="icon size-md" />. In List 
view, all hyper-datasets are shown side-by-side. In Project view, hyper-datasets are organized according to their projects, and 
top-level projects are displayed. Click on a project card to view the project's hyper-datasets.

Click on a Hyper-Dataset card to open the dataset's [version list](webapp_datasets_versioning.md), where you can view 
and manage the dataset versions' lineage and contents. 

Filter the hyper-datasets to find the one you're looking for more easily. These filters can be applied by clicking <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-filter-off.svg" alt="Filter" className="icon size-md" />:
* My Work - Show only hyper-datasets that you created
* Tags - Choose which tags to filter by from a list of tags used in the hyper-datasets.
  * Filter by multiple tag values using the **ANY** or **ALL** options, which correspond to the logical "AND" and "OR" 
  respectively. These options appear on the top of the tag list.
  * Filter by the absence of a tag (logical "NOT") by clicking its checkbox twice. An X will appear in the tag's checkbox.

## Project Cards

In Project view, project cards display a project's summarized hyper-dataset information:

<div class="max-w-50">

![Hyper-Dataset project card](../../img/hyperdatasets/hyperdataset_project_card.png#light-mode-only)
![Hyper-Dataset project card](../../img/hyperdatasets/hyperdataset_project_card_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

* Project name
* Number of hyper-datasets in project
* Tags used by hyper-datasets in project

Click on a project card to view its hyper-datasets.


## Hyper-Dataset Cards

In List view, the Hyper-Dataset cards display summarized dataset information: 

<div class="max-w-50">

![Hyper-Dataset card](../../img/hyperdatasets/hyperdataset_card.png#light-mode-only)
![Hyper-Dataset card](../../img/hyperdatasets/hyperdataset_card_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

* Dataset name
* Time since last update. Hover over elapsed time to view date of last update
* User updating the Dataset
* If the dataset contains dataset-level metadata, the card displays the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-status-completed.svg" alt="Check mark" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
    `Metadata` indicator, which opens the Metadata editor on click 
* The number of versions in the Dataset
* The total number of frames in all versions of the Dataset. If an asterisk (\*) appears next to **FRAMES**, then you can hover over it and see the name of the version whose frames were last updated
* The percentage of frames annotated in all versions of the Dataset. If an asterisk (\*) appears next to **ANNOTATED**, then you can hover over it and see the name of the version whose frames were last annotated
* If the Dataset version's status is *Published*, then the Dataset's top labels appear (colors are editable). If the 
  Dataset version is *Draft*, then no labels appear
* Tags

:::note Change Label Color
To change the label color coding, hover over a label color, click the hand pointer, and then select a new color.

### Hyper-Dataset Actions

Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-bars-menu.svg" alt="Menu" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> on the top right
of a dataset card to open its context menu and access dataset actions:  

<div class="max-w-75">

![Hyper-Dataset context menu](../../img/hyperdatasets/webapp_hyperdataset_card_context_menu.png#light-mode-only)
![Hyper-Dataset context menu](../../img/hyperdatasets/webapp_hyperdataset_card_context_menu_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

* **Copy Dataset ID**
* **View Dataset Schema** - View the dataset's frame document schema. This shows the framesâ€™ fields and their types.
* **Rename** - Change the dataset's name
* **Add Tag** - Add label to the dataset to help easily classify groups of datasets.
* **Edit Metadata** - Modify dataset-level metadata. This will open the metadata edit window, where you can edit the section

## Create New Hyper-Datasets

To create a Hyper-Dataset, click the **+ NEW DATASET** button in the top right of the page, which will open a 
**New Dataset** modal.

<div class="max-w-50">

![Hyper-Dataset creation modal](../../img/hyperdatasets/webapp_hyperdataset_creation.png#light-mode-only)
![Hyper-Dataset creation modal](../../img/hyperdatasets/webapp_hyperdataset_creation_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

This creates a new Hyper-Dataset that contains a single, empty draft version.
