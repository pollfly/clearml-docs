title: Air-Gapped Environments
---

This guide covers how to deploy and operate ClearML in **air-gapped environments**â€”environments with restricted or no 
internet access. It includes steps for locally hosting all required resources and configuring ClearML components accordingly.

The guide covers:

- Hosting dependencies for ClearML Applications
- Configuring application containers with offline resources
- Configuring Kubernetes deployments using private registries and image pull secrets

## Preparing ClearML Applications for Air-Gapped Use

Various application dependencies that are auto-downloaded from the internet can be locally hosted and configured for offline access.

### Hosting Required Python Packages

Ensure the following Python packages are locally hosted in your PyPI proxy or Python packages artifactory, and are
accessible using a local URL. Alternatively, if you are going to use custom images, make sure they are installed.

```requirements
jupyter
jupyterlab>4,<4.4
traitlets
mitmproxy<10.2
werkzeug>2,<3.0 ; python_version < '3.9'
clearml>=1.9
clearml_session==0.16.0
tqdm
boto3>=1.9
pylint
clearml-agent
```


### Setting PIP Indexes

Configure the Python package index for pip using one of the following environment variables:
* `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` - Adds a custom index in addition to the default
* `PIP_INDEX_URL` - Replaces the default index with a custom one (only a single index will be used)

The following is an example in Kubernetes using the ClearML Agent helm values override:

```yaml
agentk8sglue:
  queues:
    myQueue:
      templateOverrides:
        env:
          - name: PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL
            value: "<LOCAL_REPO_URL>"
```

For further pip configuration options, see the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#options). 

#### Trusting Pip Index
To configure pip to trust your local PyPI repository (for example, if it uses a self-signed certificate), use one of the 
following methods:

* Use `PIP_TRUSTED_HOST` environment variable:

  ```yaml
  agentk8sglue:
    queues:
      myQueue:
        templateOverrides:
          env:
            - name: PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL
              value: "<LOCAL_REPO_URL>"
            - name: PIP_TRUSTED_HOST
              value: "<LOCAL_REPO_HOST_NAME>"
  ```

* Mount a custom `pip.conf` file:

  ```yaml
  agentk8sglue:
    queues:
      myQueue:
        templateOverrides:
          fileMounts:
            - name: "pip.conf"
              folderPath: "/root/.pip"
              fileContent: |-
                [global]
                index-url = <LOCAL_REPO_URL>
                trusted-host = <LOCAL_REPO_HOST_NAME>
  ```

### Setting App Environment Variables


Application environment variables (see [below](#app-specific-offline-resources)) can be set using any of the following:

- [ClearML Administrator Vault](../../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_admin_vaults.md) configuration: Set `agent.extra_docker_arguments`
- Agent config on VMs or bare-metal: Set `agent.extra_docker_arguments`
- Kubernetes ClearML Agent deployments: Set the `basePodTemplate`

Ensure that:

* All containers and pods are configured to pull images from your private container registry
* Custom images include Python 3


### App-Specific Offline Resources

#### VSCode Application 

For the ClearML VSCode Application to work offline, provide the following to all containers started by the ClearML Agent 
running GPU workloads:

- **VSCode Server debian package**: Set `CLEARML_SESSION_VSCODE_SERVER_DEB=<PATH_TO_DEB_FILE>`. Package can be found [here](https://github.com/coder/code-server/releases/download/v4.96.2/code-server_4.96.2_amd64.deb) 
(version number can be updated, see https://github.com/coder/code-server/releases).
- **VSCode Python extension**: Set `CLEARML_SESSION_VSCODE_PY_EXT=<PATH_TO_EXTENSION_FILE>` pointing to the Visual Studio 
  marketplace. Package can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/ms-python/vsextensions/python/2022.12.0/vspackage) 
  (version number can be updated, see the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)).

Example in Kubernetes using the ClearML Agent helm values override:

```yaml
agentk8sglue:
  queues:
    myQueue:
      templateOverrides:
        env:
          - name: CLEARML_SESSION_VSCODE_SERVER_DEB
            value: "<PATH_TO_DEB_FILE>"
          - name: CLEARML_SESSION_VSCODE_PY_EXT
            value: "<PATH_TO_EXTENSION_FILE>"
```

#### SSH Session Application

For air-gapped SSH applications using the DropBear server (required for non-privileged containers):
* Download and host the [DropBear executable](https://github.com/allegroai/dropbear/releases/download/DROPBEAR_CLEARML_2023.02/dropbearmulti). 
* Set `CLEARML_DROPBEAR_EXEC=<PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE>` in all containers started by the ClearML Agent running GPU workloads


### Convert Image Registry

[ClearML Application](apps_k8s.md) installation requires running the `convert_image_registry.py` script
included in the package. Images that need to be mirrored will be listed in the script output of the same script. Mirror these images
to your private registry before proceeding 
with the upload of application packages.

## Kubernetes Environments

### Use a Custom imagePullSecret

To ensure Kubernetes workloads (ClearML Agents, Server, and App Gateway) use your private registry, configure `imagePullSecrets` 
in the appropriate Helm override files.

* To use a custom defined `imagePullSecret` for a **ClearML Agent** and the tasks Pods it creates, configure the following 
  in your `clearml-agent-values.override.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  imageCredentials:
    extraImagePullSecrets:
      - name: "<IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME>"
  ```

* To use a custom defined `imagePullSecret` for the **ClearML Server**, configure the following in your `clearml-values.override.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  imageCredentials:
    existingImagePullSecrets:
      - name: "<IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME>"
  ```

* To use a custom defined `imagePullSecret` for the **ClearML App Gateway**, configure the following in your `clearml-app-gateway-values.override.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  imageCredentials:
    existingImagePullSecrets:
      - name: "<IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME>"
  ```

### Create a Custom imagePullSecret

To create a registry secret in Kubernetes, use the following command example. The secret needs to be created in the namespace where it will be used.

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry -n <NAMESPACE> <SECRET_NAME> \
  --docker-server=<REPO_URL> \
  --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
  --docker-password=<PASSWORD> \
  --docker-email=<EMAIL_OR_EMPTY_STRING>
```

### List Images Used in a ClearML Helm Chart

To see all container images used by a ClearML Helm chart:

```bash
helm template <CHART_NAME> | yq '..|.image? | select(.)' | sort -u
```


:::note
This requires the `helm` and `yq` commands to be installed.
:::

## Webserver

When using a private registry, this configuration will make the Webserver reference the correct extra index URL for 
Enterprise packages.

In Kubernetes:

```yaml
clearml:
  extraIndexUrl: "<YOUR_REPO_URL>"
```
